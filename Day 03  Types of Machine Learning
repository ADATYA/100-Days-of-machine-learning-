# ü§ñ Machine Learning Types: Summary with Subcategories & Examples

Machine Learning (ML) is categorized into four primary types:

1. **Supervised Learning**
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**
4. **Reinforcement Learning**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Supervised Learning

**Definition:** Learns from labeled data (input ‚Üí output).

### Subtypes:
- **Classification** (categorical output)
  - Example: Email spam detection (`spam` / `not spam`)
- **Regression** (numerical output)
  - Example: Predicting house prices

### Real-World Examples:
- Credit scoring
- Disease prediction
- Weather forecasting

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Unsupervised Learning

**Definition:** Learns from **unlabeled data** by discovering hidden patterns.

### Subtypes:
- **Clustering**
  - Example: Customer segmentation
- **Dimensionality Reduction**
  - Example: PCA for data visualization
- **Anomaly Detection**
  - Example: Fraud or intrusion detection
- **Association Rule Learning**
  - Example: Market basket analysis

### Real-World Examples:
- Recommendation engines
- Pattern discovery
- Outlier detection

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Semi-Supervised Learning

**Definition:** Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.

### Techniques:
- Self-training
- Co-training
- Pseudo-labeling
- Graph-based methods

### Real-World Examples:
- Medical imaging (few expert-labeled scans)
- Speech recognition
- Social media content classification

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Learning (RL)

**Definition:** An agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

### Core Concepts:
- **Agent**, **Environment**, **State**, **Action**, **Reward**

### Types:
- **Positive vs Negative Reinforcement**
- **Model-Free vs Model-Based**
- **Policy-Based vs Value-Based**

### Real-World Examples:
- Game AI (Chess, Go, Atari)
- Robotics
- Self-driving cars
- Ad recommendation systems
