# 🧠 Machine Learning Overview

A concise reference covering key Machine Learning paradigms:

- Batch Learning
- Offline vs Online Learning

---

## 📦 Batch Machine Learning

**Definition:**  
Batch learning is a machine learning paradigm where the model is trained on the **entire dataset at once**. The system doesn't update continuously. Instead, it's retrained periodically with a new batch of data.

### 🔹 Characteristics:
- Learns from the full dataset
- Not updated in real-time
- Typically more accurate due to full data availability
- High computational load
- Training and inference are separated phases

### ✅ Real-Life Examples:
- Predicting housing prices using a historical dataset
- Fraud detection models retrained weekly
- E-commerce recommendation models updated nightly
- Customer churn prediction trained monthly

## 🔁 Offline Learning vs Online Learning

### 🧊 Offline Learning (Static)

**Definition:**  
Also known as batch learning. The model is trained on static data and then deployed for inference. No updates happen during prediction.

#### ✅ Use Cases:
- Image classification models trained on labeled datasets
- Monthly retrained recommendation systems
- Fraud models updated weekly

### 🔄 Online Learning (Dynamic)

**Definition:**  
Online learning is a machine learning approach where the model learns **continuously from streaming data**, updating incrementally.

#### 🔹 Characteristics:
- Learns one data point at a time
- Suitable for real-time systems
- Can adapt to concept drift (changes in data patterns)

#### ✅ Real-Life Examples:
- Stock price prediction systems
- Real-time click-through rate (CTR) prediction
- Dynamic pricing engines
- Live recommendation systems on streaming platforms
