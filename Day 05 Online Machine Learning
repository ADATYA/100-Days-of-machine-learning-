## 📌 What is Online Machine Learning?

**Online Machine Learning** (also called **incremental learning**) is a learning paradigm where the model **learns continuously** as new data arrives — one instance (or a small batch) at a time.

Unlike traditional **batch learning**, it does **not require re-training the entire model** from scratch.

## 🧠 Why Use Online Learning?

Online learning is essential when:

- Data is **streaming in real-time**
- The data distribution **changes over time** (concept drift)
- You **can't store the entire dataset in memory**
- The system needs to **adapt quickly to new patterns**

## ⚖️ Online vs Offline Learning

| Feature              | 🧊 Offline Learning                     | 🔄 Online Learning                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Data Usage           | Full dataset at once (batch)           | One data point at a time               |
| Model Updates        | Periodically retrained                 | Continuously updated                   |
| Latency              | High (due to retraining)               | Low (real-time response)               |
| Adaptability         | Poor for changing data                 | Excellent for dynamic environments     |
| Memory Requirement   | High (entire dataset needed)           | Low (partial/incremental data only)    |
| Accuracy             | Often higher (more stable)             | May fluctuate with noisy data          |
| Complexity           | Simpler models                         | Needs careful tuning                   |

## 👍 Advantages of Online Learning

- ✅ Real-time model updates
- ✅ Handles large or infinite datasets
- ✅ Adapts to concept drift (changing patterns)
- ✅ Low memory footprint
- ✅ Ideal for **personalized** and **interactive** systems

---

## 👎 Disadvantages of Online Learning

- ❌ More sensitive to **noisy data**
- ❌ Requires careful **hyperparameter tuning**
- ❌ No "replay" — data is often processed only once
- ❌ Harder to debug or audit model decisions
- ❌ Risk of **catastrophic forgetting** (overwriting old knowledge)
