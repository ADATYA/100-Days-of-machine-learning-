# üß† Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning (ML Paradigms)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Instance-Based Learning?

**Definition:**  
Instance-Based Learning (IBL) stores training examples and **makes predictions by comparing new input to stored instances** (usually using distance metrics).

> üß© It **does not generalize** from the training data beforehand ‚Äî generalization happens at prediction time.

### ‚úÖ Why Use It?
- Great when patterns are **local** or **non-linear**
- Requires **little to no training time**

### üí° Examples:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Case-Based Reasoning
- Some recommender systems (collaborative filtering)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is Model-Based Learning?

**Definition:**  
Model-Based Learning builds an **explicit model** from training data (a function that maps inputs to outputs), which is then used for predictions.

> üîß Generalization happens **during training**, and prediction is fast.

### ‚úÖ Why Use It?
- Better for large-scale problems
- Efficient at prediction time
- Can extrapolate from trends in the data

### üí° Examples:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- SVMs

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison Table: Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning

| Feature                      | üßÆ Instance-Based Learning                    | üß† Model-Based Learning                        |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Training Time**           | Very low (stores data)                        | High (needs model training)                    |
| **Prediction Time**         | High (needs to search data)                   | Fast (uses learned model)                      |
| **Generalization**          | At prediction time                            | During training                                |
| **Storage Requirement**     | High (stores most/all data)                   | Low (stores only model parameters)             |
| **Flexibility**             | High (no assumptions on data shape)           | May require tuning model complexity            |
| **Noise Sensitivity**       | High (affected by noisy samples)              | Lower (can learn smoothed representation)      |
| **Interpretability**        | Often simple (e.g., KNN)                      | Depends on model used                          |
| **Examples**                | KNN, Case-Based Reasoning                     | SVM, Decision Trees, Linear Regression         |
| **Best When**               | Few data points, complex decision boundaries  | Many samples, general trends in data           |

# üß™ Code Example: KNN vs Logistic Regression

We'll compare an instance-based model (KNN) and a model-based one (Logistic Regression) on a simple classification task.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=500, n_features=10, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Instance-Based: KNN
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
knn_preds = knn.predict(X_test)

# Model-Based: Logistic Regression
logreg = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)
logreg_preds = logreg.predict(X_test)

# Accuracy
print("KNN Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, knn_preds))
print("Logistic Regression Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, logreg_preds))
