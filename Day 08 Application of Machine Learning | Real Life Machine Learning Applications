## Core ML Techniques and When to Use Them

* **Supervised Learning** (classification, regression): when labeled data exists. Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks.
* **Unsupervised Learning** (clustering, dimensionality reduction): customer segmentation, anomaly detection. Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE/UMAP.
* **Deep Learning (DL)**: images (CNNs), sequential/time-series (RNN/LSTM/Transformer), language (Transformers/BERT/RoBERTa).
* **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: sequential decision-making (robotics, trading, recommendation exploration).
* **Graph ML**: data represented as graphs (social networks, molecules) — use GNNs.
* **Probabilistic Models & Bayesian methods**: when you need uncertainty quantification.
