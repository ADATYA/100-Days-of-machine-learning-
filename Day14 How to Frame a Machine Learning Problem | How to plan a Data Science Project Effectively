# 🎥 Netflix Movie Recommendation System

## 🧩 Project Overview
Netflix aims to increase user engagement by recommending the most relevant content.  
As an ML Engineer, our goal is to **predict what movie or series a user will watch next** based on their past behavior.

---

## 🏢 Business Problem

Netflix users spend less time discovering new shows.  
Goal: **Increase watch time and reduce churn** by improving personalized recommendations.

---

## 🔍 ML Problem Formulation

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Type of Problem** | Recommendation / Ranking |
| **Target Variable (y)** | Probability that a user will watch a movie |
| **Input Features (X)** | User history, genre preferences, device type, time of day, watch duration, similar users |
| **Prediction Goal** | Rank top-N movies for each user |

---

## 📊 Data Sources

| Source | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| User Behavior Logs | Movie IDs, ratings, watch duration |
| Content Metadata | Genre, cast, release year, tags |
| User Profile | Age, country, device, subscription type |

---

## ⚙️ Current Solution

Currently, Netflix uses collaborative filtering and deep learning models (e.g., **Matrix Factorization**, **Autoencoders**, **Transformer-based recommenders**) to rank items.  
Our prototype improves upon this by combining **content-based** + **collaborative** features.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| Precision@K | How many of top-K recommendations are relevant |
| Recall@K | How many relevant items are recommended |
| NDCG | Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (ranking quality) |
| Watch Time | Business metric to measure success post-deployment |

---

## 🧪 Assumptions

- User history data available for past 6 months.  
- Cold-start problem handled via content features.  
- No data leakage from future events.

---

## 🔁 System Design

### Offline (Batch)
- Train model daily on Spark or PyTorch.
- Store embeddings in feature store.

### Online (Real-time)
- Fetch pre-computed recommendations or refresh on user action.

---

## 🧠 Model Options

1. **Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization)**
2. **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**
3. **Transformer-based Sequential Models**
4. **Hybrid Recommender (Content + CF)**

---

## 🧩 Pipeline Overview

Raw Data → Feature Engineering → Train/Test Split → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring

---

## 🚀 Deployment Plan

- Model served via **FastAPI** endpoint.  
- Batch inference with **Airflow** scheduler.  
- Model tracking with **MLflow**.  
- Results visualized on dashboard (Streamlit).

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| Data | Spark, Pandas |
| Model | PyTorch / TensorFlow |
| Deployment | FastAPI, Docker |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana |

---

## ✅ Results

| Metric | Before | After (Our Model) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Precision@10 | 0.21 | 0.35 |
| Recall@10 | 0.42 | 0.58 |
| Watch Time ↑ | +18% |

---

## 📚 Future Work

- Handle cold-start users via demographic embedding.
- Introduce context-aware recommendations (time, mood).
- Real-time personalization using reinforcement learning.
